            And now off goes the excursion train, gentlemen! I hope we shall have a
            lively time, as a certain fair lady puts it.<br>
        </p>

        <p id="2">    <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
            Ah, if only the fair lady could be present unseen--!<br>
        </p>

        <p id="3">    <h6>BRACK.</h6>
            Why unseen?<br>
        </p>

        <p id="4">  <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
            In order to hear a little of your liveliness at first hand, Judge Brack.<br>
        </p>    
        <p id="5"> <h6>BRACK.</h6>
            <p>[Laughing.]</p> I should not advise the fair lady to try it.<br>
        </p>    
        <p id="7">    <h6>TESMAN.</h6>
            <p>[Also laughing.]</p> Come, you're a nice one Hedda! Fancy that!<br>
        </p>    
        <p id="8">    <h6>BRACK.</h6>
            Well, good-bye, good-bye, ladies.<br>
