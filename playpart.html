            BRACK.<br>
            
            And now off goes the excursion train, gentlemen! I hope we shall have a
            lively time, as a certain fair lady puts it.<br>

            HEDDA.<br>

            Ah, if only the fair lady could be present unseen--!<br>

            BRACK.<br>

            Why unseen?<br>

            HEDDA.<br>

            In order to hear a little of your liveliness at first hand, Judge Brack.<br>
            
            BRACK.<br>
            
            [Laughing.] I should not advise the fair lady to try it.<br>
            
            TESMAN.<br>
            
            [Also laughing.] Come, you're a nice one Hedda! Fancy that!<br>
            
            BRACK.<br>
            Well, good-bye, good-bye, ladies.<br>
            
            LOVBORG.<br>
            [Bowing.] About ten o'clock, then,
            [BRACK, LOVBORG, and TESMAN go out by the hall door.  At the same time, BERTA enters from the inner room with a lighted
            lamp, which she places on the drawing-room table; she goes out by the way she came.<br>


            MRS. ELVSTED.<br>

            [Who has risen and is wandering restlessly about the room.] Hedda--
            Hedda--what will come of all this?<br>
