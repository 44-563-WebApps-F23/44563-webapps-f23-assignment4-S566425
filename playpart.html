            BRACK.<br>
            
            And now off goes the excursion train, gentlemen! I hope we shall have a
            lively time, as a certain fair lady puts it.<br>

            HEDDA.<br>

            Ah, if only the fair lady could be present unseen--!<br>

            BRACK.<br>

            Why unseen?<br>

            HEDDA.<br>

            In order to hear a little of your liveliness at first hand, Judge Brack.<br>
            
            BRACK.<br>
            
            [Laughing.] I should not advise the fair lady to try it.<br>
            
            TESMAN.<br>
            
            [Also laughing.] Come, you're a nice one Hedda! Fancy that!<br>
            
            BRACK.<br>
            Well, good-bye, good-bye, ladies.<br>
            
            LOVBORG.<br>
            [Bowing.] About ten o'clock, then,
            [BRACK, LOVBORG, and TESMAN go out by the hall door.  At the same time, BERTA enters from the inner room with a lighted
            lamp, which she places on the drawing-room table; she goes out by the way she came.<br>


MRS. ELVSTED.

[Who has risen and is wandering restlessly about the room.] Hedda--
Hedda--what will come of all this?


HEDDA.

At ten o'clock--he will be here. I can see him already--with vine-leaves
in his hair--flushed and fearless--


MRS. ELVSTED.

Oh, I hope he may.


HEDDA.

And then, you see--then he will have regained control over himself. Then
he will be a free man for all his days.


MRS. ELVSTED.

Oh God!--if he would only come as you see him now!


HEDDA.

He will come as I see him--so, and not otherwise! [Rises and approaches
THEA.] You may doubt him as long as you please; _I_ believe in him. And
now we will try--


MRS. ELVSTED.

You have some hidden motive in this, Hedda!


HEDDA.

Yes, I have. I want for once in my life to have power to mould a human
destiny.


MRS. ELVSTED.

Have you not the power?


HEDDA.

I have not--and have never had it.


MRS. ELVSTED.

Not your husband's?


HEDDA.

Do you think that is worth the trouble? Oh, if you could only understand
how poor I am. And fate has made you so rich! [Clasps her passionately
in her arms.] I think I must burn your hair off after all.


MRS. ELVSTED.

Let me go! Let me go! I am afraid of you, Hedda!


BERTA.

[In the middle doorway.] Tea is laid in the dining-room, ma'am.


HEDDA.

Very well. We are coming


MRS. ELVSTED.

No, no, no! I would rather go home alone! At once!


HEDDA.

Nonsense! First you shall have a cup of tea, you little stupid. And
then--at ten o'clock--Eilert Lovborg will be here--with vine-leaves in
his hair.

   [She drags MRS. ELVSTED almost by force to the middle doorway.
